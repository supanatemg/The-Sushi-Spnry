#00629,"   Good news for owners of revolving sushi restaurants! Legendary sushi magnate Tabero Jusan (age 82) has agreed to share some secrets of his success.<br>   ""Customers will pay a lot of money for the kind of sushi they like best. In particular, kids like <co=3366ff>tamago</co> and senior citizens like <co=3366ff>anko</co>! Of course it goes without saying that it has to taste good, too.""<br>   There you have it. Perhaps your restaurant should try offering these items as specials?"
#00630,   Word has it that <name> is boasting a new <0>. A local college student who had heard about it on TV remarked that he may stop in to see the <0> on his way home from work.<br>   It seems that adding new amenities is key to attracting new customers.
#00631,"   A recent industry survey revealed that some customers will visit a restaurant just to use its amenities, then leave without eating anything.<br>   Usage of amenities like vending machines can yield Sushi Coins, so businesses interested in making it big should consider installing several.<br>   Some amenities can also whet the appetite, so placing them in strategic locations is vital."
#00632,"   We've learned that <name> has just welcomed its 50th customer. In an exclusive interview, that customer had this to say:<br>   ""Thank you. I'm just happy that I could be here on such a special day. I plan to eat a lot!""<br>   We suspect that this is only the beginning of a large and loyal customer base for <name>!"
#00633,"   Do you know what it means when your seats change? We asked a professional interior designer.<br>   ""When you place decor items near seats, it can trigger a spontaneous upgrade. Good seats encourage customers to sit longer and eat more,"" said the expert while munching on some salmon.<br>   Interior design is an important point to keep in mind if you want to create a popular restaurant."
#00634,"   Today we bring you the results of a study conducted by our editorial staff entitled, ""How to make people eat more sushi.""<br>   Offering novel dishes in addition to old stand-bys tends to attract more customers, so developing new dishes is important.<br>   What's more, each customer's appetite can be stimulated by certain amenities. Other amenities can aid in digestion.<br>   Taking advantage of these tips should put you on the fast track to success in no time."
#00635,"   <name> has a new dish on the menu: <co=0066cc><0></co>! <1>, the first customer to try it, had this to say about it:<br>   ""It has a mellow, full-bodied flavor but isn't overpowering. It seemed to put me in a mellow mood, too...""<br>   We've heard that developing dishes tends to go well when using ingredients that are in season. We can't wait to see what <name> has in store for us next."
#00636,"   According to our sources, <name>'s conveyor belt has reached a total length of 20m. The longer the belt, the more seats can be accommodated and the more food can be made available at once--meaning more satisfied customers.<br>   One customer put it well: ""The feeling of anticipation you get from seeing a favorite dish approaching from a distance is the best part of revolving sushi bars!"""
#00637,"   <name>'s conveyor belt has now reached a total length of 40m. The restaurant's interior looks like a regular sushi museum, with locals proudly proclaiming it a town landmark.<br>   <name> is particularly popular with children, who often request birthday parties there."
#00638,"   Making delicious sushi requires not only skillful preparation but also a discerning eye, according to Goro Higashidama, a veteran chef of 30 years.<br>   ""The secret to creating new dishes is to develop your chefs' discernment so they can choose the best ingredients. If that ingredient happens to be in season, the selection process should go even better,"" he said.<br>   This advice is well worth keeping in mind on your next visit to the fish market."
#00639,"   We've just learned that <name> has won its first sushi competition.<br>   One judge commented, ""The other entrants weren't bad, but I felt they just didn't put enough love into their sushi.""<br>   This victory has raised the restaurant's name recognition, perhaps winning them some new customers as well."
#00640,"   Our sources inform us that <name> has received a third star in the National Sushi Rankings.<br>   ""They just get better every time,"" said the chairman of the Sushi Council. ""But they'll need to work at developing new dishes in the future. I just might drop in myself if they come up with something good.""<br>   How high will they score next time? We can't wait to find out."
#00641,"   We've just learned that <name> has received a fifth star in the National Sushi Rankings.<br>   Though some within the industry expressed surprise, one anonymous commenter felt it was only natural, adding, ""I own a sushi bar myself, but I eat at <name> regularly!""<br>   The news has turned heads in the blogosphere and the travel industry, amongst others, and we can safely say that the restaurant is now a household name. Congratulations!"
#00642,"   Today we asked legendary sushi chef Tatsuo Sakuramoto to share some of his secrets to winning competitions.<br>   ""Preparing food that meets a contest's standards is key. If high flavor and aroma are called for, choose ingredients with high flavor and aroma,"" he said.<br>   ""Finding good ingredients is vital. Use a chef with keen discernment and don't be afraid to use a lot of <co=3366ff>Sushi Coins</co>."""
#00643,"   Today we asked a management consultant how to best obtain <co=0066cc>Sushi Coins</co>.<br>   ""One of my clients once used a conveyor belt that was too long, putting too much distance between seats and amenities,"" he said. ""Customers tend to use amenities near their seats, so placing them in easily accessible locations is a good way to increase <co=0066cc>Sushi Coins</co>.""<br>   Sakabe Sushi apparently began winning contests regularly after following this advice. Placing amenities near seats can lead to impressive growth, it seems."
#00644,"   Word has it that <name> is having orders cancelled. A source who wished to remain anonymous said, ""Their food is great, but orders take forever to arrive, so I end up cancelling.""<br>   Building more prep stations and assigning chefs highly skilled at food preparation would likely resolve this issue."

,But you can keep playing for as long as you like! Have fun!
#01186,"Select ""<co=3366ff>Conveyor Belt</co>"" from the ""Environment"" menu."

,"You can rotate the prep stations, so orient them to best suit the shape of the conveyor belt."
#01189,"We got a Takeout Corner! Boxed lunches will be made each morning, based on what's currently available on the menu."
,Arranging a highly profitable menu will also boost the profitability of these boxed lunches.

#01191,It looks like you're running low on funds...

#01237,"I was so nervous, I ate four bowls of rice this morning! I'll do my best!"
#01238,"Sounds promising. Well, it's almost time, so we had better go."

#01249,The prototype is almost complete. We just have to finish it off.
,"Depending on the compatibility of the ingredients, you may get a bonus."
#01250,We're currently in the middle of <co=3366ff><0></co>. We will need about <co=3366ff><1></co> until it is done.
#01251,"Oh, dear. You have no chefs. Why not put the word out that you're hiring?"
#01252,Who do you want to send out for training? Just remember that they won't be back for a while.
#01253,The chef is currently away for training and can't develop new dishes.
#01254,I overheard. I'll add it to your <co=3366ff>proposals</co>.
#01255,"Well, well. I go out for a stroll and find the nicest little restaurant."
,"Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. The name's Pumpkin Jones II. I'm a management consultant."
,"A lot goes into running a restaurant: purchasing, advertising, and hiring to name a few."
,"With my extensive connections, I'm sure you'll find my services helpful."
#01256,"So you've met the consultant. You can talk to him anytime by selecting ""<co=3366ff>Consult</co>"" from the menu."
#01257,"Welcome! Oh, there's something I forgot to mention earlier."
,"To make new connections or train staff, <co=0066cc>Sushi Coins</co> are needed to facilitate the negotiations."
,You can get Sushi Coins when customers use the cash registers or amenities at your restaurant.
,Now let's get started. I currently have<co=3366ff> <0> </co>proposals for <name>.
#01258,"Welcome, welcome. How are you? What can I do for you today?"
#01259,Thank you. I hope to see you again soon.
#01260,Here you can select up to two specials.
,"Your chefs will give them priority, so try to balance profitability and customer satisfaction."
#01261,Hello. I'm from the National Sushi Council.
,We aim to promote sushi worldwide and improve technology in the industry.
,"To that end, we inspect sushi restaurants nationwide and rank them every six months."
,We've now registered <name> in our books. I'm sure you will do well.
,The next rankings will be announced next month. Good luck.
#01262,Hello. Thanks for all of your hard work.
,"I'm afraid you didn't get a star this time, but you did get a very respectable score all the same."
#01263,Hello. Thanks for all of your hard work.
,I'm happy to say that you've won your first star! I knew I was right about you!
,I've brought you a special award. I hope it proves useful.
#01264,"In addition to food, you are rated on your amenities, the quality of your seats, and your service."
,"You can try maximizing your score by using <co=0066cc>items</co> or <co=0066cc>decor</co>. Well, see you later."
#01265,Recently I've noticed a lot of customers leaving early because they've run out of cash.
,Maybe we should talk to the bank about having an ATM installed!
#01266,Our customer finished eating and paid the bill at the cash register!
,Customers pay for the sushi they've eaten at the register. The money then goes toward the restaurant.
,You can recommend popular types of sushi as specials for an added boost to sales!
,See the newly added <co=3366ff>Sushi Coins</co> in the upper right corner of the screen? We'll need those later.
#01267,Amenity installed! It should provide some supplementary income whenever customers use it.
,"Amenities can make a restaurant more popular, but remember that you have to pay for their upkeep."
#01268,That's wonderful!
,Now our selection of products should be even better. I look forward to serving you in the future.
#01269,"Thanks for your business. Actually, there's something I'd like to discuss with you."
,"You're one of our best customers, so I'd like to talk about improving our selection of products."
,I was wondering if you could speak to Mr. Pumpkin about finding more suppliers for me.
#01270,"Thanks for your business. Actually, there's something I want to discuss with you."
,I could use your help in expanding our product selection even more.
#01271,Newly hired chefs must be assigned to prep stations. Select a prep station to change the assigned chef.
#01272,"I see. That's a good idea. We should enter too! Select ""<co=3366ff>Contest</co>"" from the ""<co=3366ff>Manage</co>"" menu to enter."
#01273,"Boss! Now that the restaurant is on its feet, I think we should try developing some new dishes."
,"The test kitchen equipment I ordered has arrived, so why don't we set it up?"
#01274,"The test kitchen is ready. To develop new dishes, we need a chef. I've asked a friend to help us out."
#01275,Hello! I'll do my best to make you the best sushi you've ever tasted!
#01276,"We're now ready to develop a new dish. From the menu, select ""<co=3366ff>Dishes</co>"" and then ""<co=3366ff>Develop new dish</co>."""
#01277,The dish with the highest overall quality will be selected and given a score.
,"Try to develop dishes so that their <co=3366ff>flavor, texture</co>,<co=3366ff> aroma, </co>and<co=3366ff> color</co> scores are high across the board."
#01278,The two staff members with the highest Service ability are selected and given scores.
,"To get high scores, try to hire highly skilled staff or develop their skills through training."
#01279,The two types of amenities with the highest quality are selected and given scores.
,Use items to power amenities up or set decor items around them to make them more appealing.
,Entertaining amenities like pinball machines tend to earn more points than vending machines.
#01280,The <co=3366ff>two types</co> of seats with the highest quality are selected and given scores.
,Use items to power seats up or set decor items around them to make them more appealing.
,Seats also become more appealing when staff with good customer service skills are working nearby.
#01281,"So this is <name>, huh? I'm not very hungry, so I'll just use the <co=3366ff><0></co> and go home."
#01282,"I just came for the <co=0066cc><0></co>, but the sushi looks so good, I think I'll have a bite."
,"I've been dieting since this morning, so I hope it tastes good!"
#01283,It looks like our amenities have started attracting customers!
,We should add some decor items to appeal to even more customers!
#01284,"Making a seat more appealing upgrades it, making customers want to stay longer."
,You can make seats more appealing by using items or placing plants and other decor items nearby.
#01285,The season has ended! We sold a total of <0> plates for a total of <co=0066cc><1></co>!
,The restaurant will now close and the season will change to summer.
,"The ingredients in season will also change, so select new specials from the ""Manage"" menu."
#01286,<name> has just gotten its first star! We expect great things from you.
,Here is a special award just for you!
#01287,Congratulations on your second star. We've been hearing your name now and then from our readers.
,Here is your special award.
#01288,"Third star at last, eh? You're already making quite a name for yourself, you know."
,Here is your special award.
#01289,"Four stars? Splendid. You've become a household name, it seems."
,"I still remember back when you were just getting started... Sniff... Oh, here's your award, by the way."
#01290,I can't believe it! Five stars! It takes an incredible amount of work to get this far!
,Not a day goes by that I don't hear <name> mentioned as a place for the whole family to enjoy.
,"On behalf of the Sushi Council, I offer my thanks. Please accept this token of our appreciation."
#01291,"Good luck in the ongoing quest to be the best in the country! You can still keep playing, you know."
,"This concludes all of the special awards, but you can still win cash prizes, so keep it up."
,"Again, many thanks. Farewell!"
#01292,Placing this statue has a mysterious effect that appears to boost a restaurant's popularity...
,"You can even carry it over when you start a new game, so use it well!"
#01293,"It looks like the base for our prototype is just about complete, so next let's move on to assessing the ingredients."
#01294,"The base for our prototype is almost done, so next we head to the market to find good ingredients."
,"The higher a chef's <co=3366ff>discernment</co> and the more <co=3366ff>Sushi Coins</co> spent, the better the ingredients you'll get!"
,"Okay, then. Go to it, <0>."
#01295,I got a new contact lens prescription just for this day! I'm sure I'll be able to pick out some great ingredients!
#01296,We found great ingredients thanks to my keen eye. I'll work hard preparing them as well.
#01297,This happens to everyone sooner or later... But I'll make up for it during the preparation stage!
#01298,"You can rearrange amenities from the ""<co=0066cc>Build</co>"" menu."
,You can even rotate an amenity in place. It can be pretty useful.
#01299,"Well, unfortunately we didn't win, but I think we did quite well for a first attempt!"
,"Judges each have their own personal preferences, so be sure to note their reactions to the other entries."
#01300,"You need a chef to develop dishes. Try selecting ""Consult"" from the menu to hire new staff!"
#01301,The specials are now set! Let's see how our customers react.
#01302,This aquarium is a special item that greatly boosts the appeal of the surrounding area.
,"Not only that, you can even carry it over the next time you play through the game."
,Thanks a lot for taking part. I look forward to seeing you again!
#01303,We can now have two test kitchens! This will allow <co=3366ff>multiple chefs</co> to develop new dishes together.
,"That means keener discernment and better preparation. Two heads are better than one, so try it out!"
,"Oh, I guess we'll need to build the test kitchen first."
#01304,"Oh, and please take this!"
#01305,Boss! You've got a phone call from Chimpan Z.
#01306,"Hello? You're using it, aren't you? I can sense its aura."
,I have a feeling that its power might even attract a Kairobot to your restaurant.
,"One may show up if you try to recruit new staff, so by all means take advantage of it."
,Goodbye. <CLICK>
#01307,"Congratulations on ""completing"" the game! If you start a new game, the following will be carried over:"
,20% of your fans.<br>30% of your ingredient expertise.<br>Some decor items.
,"And of course, you are welcome to keep playing this game as well. Good luck!"
#01308,You can view a detailed evaluation on the next screen. Select each item for details.
#01309,"Boss, I need to discuss something with you."
,That new <co=3366ff><0></co> takes <co=3366ff>so long to prepare</co> that it's really slowing us down...
,You've got to do something!
#01310,"I happened to overhear that. If you like, I could try making a <co=3366ff>prep manual</co> for your part-time staff."
,I'll add this to your list of <co=3366ff>proposals</co>. Just let me know if you want me to make it.
#01311,Hello there! Please accept my congratulations on winning the <0>!
,"I just happened to be there at the time, and I was very impressed by your entry!"
,Please take this with my compliments.
#01312,"You got a hammer! You can use it to clear away trees outside, freeing up room for expansion."
#01313,I see. Discernment certainly is a very important skill.
,"By the way, they included free <co=3366ff>Sushi Coins</co> with that article. Try using them when assessing ingredients."
#01314,We haven't entered any competitions lately and are getting some very...persistent requests.
,"If you make something good, enter it in a contest via the ""<co=3366ff>Manage</co>"" menu. We might even win a prize!"
#01315,The chef's prep skill isn't up to the job...but it can be improved with training!
,"You can send chefs out for training from the ""<co=0066cc>Consult</co>"" menu's <co=0066cc>HR</co> section."
